sainsmart tgs     air contaminants sensor detector for arduino raspberry pi avr arm figaro the sensing element is comprised of a metal oxide semiconductor layer formed on the alumina substrate of a sensing chip together with an integrated heater  in the presence of detectable gas  sensor conductivity increases depending on gas concentration in the air  a simple electrical circuit can convert the change in conductivity to an output signal which corresponds to the gas concentration  the tgs      has high sensitivity to low concentrations of odorous gases such as ammonia and h s generated from waste materials in ofce and home environments  the sensor also has high sensitivity to low concentrations of vocs such as toluene emitted from wood nishing and construction products  figaro also offers a microprocessor  fic       which contains special software for handling the sensor s signal for appliance control applications
