sparkfun tof range finder sensor   vl     this is the sparkfun time of flight range finder  a sensor board for the vl     distance sensor  unlike most distance sensors that rely on reflected light intensity or reflected angles to determine range  the vl     uses a precise clock to measure the time it takes light to bounce back from a surface  this affords the tof range finder and vl     a great benefit over other methods because it can be much more accurate and more immune to noise  does this technology sound familiar  well it should  its the same means cellphones use to detect when the caller is holding their phone to their ear
