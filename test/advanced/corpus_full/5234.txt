auralic vega digital audio processor megahertz upsampling using latest ground breaking algorithm  megahertzupsampling technology process and up sampling all incoming pcm signal to about    mhz in   bit depth  these not only improve the precision of dac  but also create a new nyquist frequency for all pcm signal which farther away from the top end of audio frequency  as a result  our engineers are able to design a brand new analog circuit structure with more bandwidth and faster slew rate  comparing to previous design  the new structure is more transparent to audio signal with lower distortion and less noise  it also lets red book cds sound more rich and smooth  auralic orfeo class a output module in order to drive various loads  matching different power amplifiers  vega is powered with auralic s patentedorfeo class a module which is inspired by neve     analog consoles circuit design as the output stage  the principle of this module is to use a mass of small signal components with best linear characteristic  by packing them though a thermal balance procedure and bias the transistors into class a  orfeo achieves impressive performance with open loop distortion less than         the orfeo module used in vega has been selected and tweaked for lower noise while maintains its driving capability for   ohm load without any distortion raise
