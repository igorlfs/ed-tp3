adafruit dht   basic temperature humidity sensor   extras  ada     the dht   is a basic  ultra low cost digital temperature and humidity sensor  it uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air  and spits out a digital signal on the data pin  no analog input pins needed   its fairly simple to use  but requires careful timing to grab data  the only real downside of this sensor is you can only get new data from it once every   seconds  so when using our library  sensor readings can be up to   seconds old
