acoustiproduct afm  b   pack black acousti fan mounts why are fan mounts necessary   vibration from fan motors can travel into a pc case and become amplified when a fan is screwed tightly to the chassis  this unwanted noise is  vibrational  or  secondary   and it is an issue if you wish to build a very quiet or virtually silent pc   these mounts have been designed   uniquely produced by acousti products  from the drawing board  specifically to tackle fan induced vibrational noise  ultra soft fan mounts are a  no vibration  alternative to standard fan screws or hard plastic push pins   to prevent the transmission of vibrations from a motor  such as a fan motor   the vibrating part needs to be decoupled  or disengaged  from the chassis or case  and the vibrations need to be damped  that is  attenuated   acoustiproducts has selected a ultra soft silicone polymer that effectively decouples the fan from the case  and also attenuates unwanted vibration   the   dimensional shape of a fan mount is intimately related to the mount material  a fan mount must be soft enough to be effective but also designed to securely hold a fan in position  acousti products has designed both the shape and materials together to give a widely compatible fan mount that is also the very softest and most effective available  why are acousti fan mounts any better than others   acoustiproducts has chosen an ultra soft silicone polymer because it is softer and more chemically stable than cheaper and inferior alternatives like rubber or epdm  cheaper alternatives can leach oils and tend to degrade more readily over time   they also tend to be more reactive with some plastics  wires etc   than silicone  silicone is non toxic  more chemically stable  and can also tolerate higher temperatures   so it is a superior material for this particular use
