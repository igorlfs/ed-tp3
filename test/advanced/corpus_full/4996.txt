geeetech iduino nano     atmega    board v     v   mhz compatible with arduino   s ide description  the iduino nano is a small  complete  and breadboard friendly board based on the atmega     arduino nano      or atmega     arduino nano   x   it has more or less the same functionality of the arduino duemilanove  but in a different package  it lacks only a dc power jack  and works with a mini b usb cable instead of a standard one   power   the iduino nano can be powered via the mini b usb connection      v unregulated external power supply  pin      or  v regulated external power supply  pin      the power source is automatically selected to the highest voltage source   the ftdi ft   rl chip on the nano is only powered if the board is being powered over usb  as a result  when running on external  non usb  power  the    v output  which is supplied by the ftdi chip  is not available and the rx and tx leds will flicker if digital pins   or   are high    summary     microcontroller   atmel atmega        operating voltage  logic level      v     input voltage  recommended         v     input voltage  limits         v     digital i o pins       of which   provide pwm output      analog input pins         dc current per i o pin      ma     flash memory      kb  atmega     of which   kb used by bootloader      sram     kb  atmega         eeprom     kb  atmega         clock speed      mhz     dimensions         x        package list    x iduino nano     board
