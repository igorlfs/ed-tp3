hiletgo  pcs l   n motor driver controller board module stepper motor dc dual h bridge for arduino smart car power uno mega r  mega     specification  chip  st l   n dual h bridge driver chip logic voltage   v logic current  ma   ma storage temperature       to       operating mode  h bridge driver  dual  drive voltage   v   v drive current   a  max single bridge  maximum power    w driver board size  mm   mm   mm driver board weight   g dimensions    x  x  mm note   general application  when your driver is  v   v  you can enable the on board  v logic supply  when using the on board  v power supply  the    v power supply in the interface does not input voltage  but it can draw  v voltage for external use   unconventional application of high voltage drive  when the driving voltage is higher than   v  less than or equal to   v  for example  to drive a motor with rated voltage of   v  the jumper cap with  v output enabled on board voltage must be pulled out and then outside the  v output port connect  v voltage to l   n internal logic voltage supply  package included     l   n motor driver controller board modulethere are two ways to turn the system back on    flip the power switch on the back of the computer and wait for the power supply cap to discharge as the relay will reset without power   after popping the hood and examining for faults  press the button on the relay there is a red led on this for power and a green led to indicate the relay is activated  so you can be pretty sure what state this is in  any time you are trying to hot wire an atx power supply and you need a toggle function besides the switch in the back  just needs power from pin    the relay connected to pin    and then of course connections back to ground pin s
